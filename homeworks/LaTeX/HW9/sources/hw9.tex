\chapter{Homework 9: Eye Tracking}
	The purpose of the article is to promote the eye tracking testing to study the user behavior while using a web page. Consists of a system which tracks the eye motion and measures where in the web page is having more focus.

	I consider the Eye Tracking not worthly to be used in general cases, mostly because of the cost-benefit. To bigger companies, maybe it is a good way to study the effectiveness of a page in order to apply corrections and improvements.
