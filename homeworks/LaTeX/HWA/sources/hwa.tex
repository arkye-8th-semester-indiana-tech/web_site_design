		The WordPress layout designed by Elegant Themes is in overall good. The color composition meet with the brand but the images and texts are poor and diverge with the layout.

		The layout seems clean which is good to the context of house commerce. Unfortunately, the blog structure is not suited to be used as a catalog.

		I would change the structure of the page to a grid with the products for sale and the support for subscriptions and registrations. A search bar is great for cases like that, and the creation of a interactive map would be a great feature to have.
