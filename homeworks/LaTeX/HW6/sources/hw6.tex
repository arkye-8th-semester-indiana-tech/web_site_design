\chapter{Homework 6: User Testing Article}
	The purpose of the article is to inform that, in general, is not a good idea to directly take users to target pages in a Usability Test. There are specific situations which the direct approach works well. For all the other situations, the best way to figure out the usability of your Web Site is to avoid creating bias on the users.

	I agree with the author, specially because the Web Site will not be used only on the target pages, but for all kind of purposes based on the available features. Furthermore, it is important to understand how the user reach the target page, not only how the user uses they.
