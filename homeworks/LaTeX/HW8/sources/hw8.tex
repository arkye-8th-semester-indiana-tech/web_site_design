\chapter{Homework 8: Web Design Trend Predictions}
	The author guessed about how the Web Design will be between 2016/2017 by his opinion. He said that the originality will be renewed, the flat design will evolve, and the features will be designed in terms of micro experiences. The use of huge page heights will be reduced and the typography will have greater attention.

	Most of his guesses is actually happening. Newer and stylish typographies and flat design are being used in large scale. But, most of the web sites still lacks in originality and the huge page heights still are highly used nowadays. I hope for the next years that the ``mainstream'' will be changed to diversity, instead of more of the same.
