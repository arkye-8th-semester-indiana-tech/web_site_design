	\begin{enumerate}
		\item{\textbf{How many questions were asked?}

			5 questions and 3 tasks.}
		\item{\textbf{Were they open ended questions or a precise task to be performed?}

			Both. 5 open questions and 3 taks to be performed on the computer.}
		\item{\textbf{Give two examples of questions asked.}

		\begin{enumerate}
			\item{If one of the tasks was hard to perform.}
			\item{If the previous questions is positive, which improvement suggestion is possible to make}
		\end{enumerate}}
		\item{\textbf{How long did the usability study take you to do?}

			Less than 5 minutes.}
		\item{\textbf{What types of data do you think they will collect from this and how do you think it may be used?}

			From the tasks, they will collect gaps inside the system by studying the usability test videos. From the questions, they will discover if the system contains one or more usability problem, according to the users. Both will be used to improve the usability of the system.}
		\item{\textbf{Is there anything you think they should do to make it a better usability study?}

			In my opinion, they did a great usability study. The only advise I may have is about the time they will perform to study the data collected. Maybe if the questions was online, it would be easier to collect and perform studies.}
