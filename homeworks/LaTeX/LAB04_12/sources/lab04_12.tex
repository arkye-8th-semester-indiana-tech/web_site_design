\chapter{Article: Radical Redesign or Incremental Change?}
	The purpose of the article is to orient the reader to think about the objectives of a Redesign and, if the reasons are conclusives, how to identify the best approach to develop the changes. The article recommends to start understanding the problem in order to make the Redesign a reasonable project. The approach of incremental changes is better suited on general cases, but the Radical Redesign can be used on specific situations.

	The orientations made by the author are very helpful and truthful for me. Too many projects fail because the lack of comprehension about the problem, if exists. After that, the wrong approach can create even more problems. The conclusion described in the article is just right: The approach must agree with the user needs and the business goals.
